## Data Structures in Go

This project is a comprehensive implementation of fundamental **data structures** using the **Go programming language (Golang)**. The main purpose of this repository is to understand how data structures work internally, focusing on **pointer manipulation**, **memory handling**, and **algorithm design** without relying on built-in collections.

### ✅ Implemented Data Structures

- **Singly Linked List** – Sequential nodes connected in a single direction.
- **Doubly Linked List** – Nodes linked forward and backward for easier traversal.
- **Circular Linked List** – The last node links back to the first.
- **Doubly Circular Linked List** – Circular structure with bidirectional links.
- **Stack (LIFO)** – Last-In, First-Out implementation.
- **Queue (FIFO)** – First-In, First-Out structure using linked nodes.
- **Binary Tree** – Hierarchical data structure with recursive operations.
- **Other utilities and custom structures** for practising algorithms.

### 🎯 Project Goals

- Strengthen understanding of low-level data management.
- Practice struct-based design and pointer usage in Go.
- Implement core operations:
  - Insertion
  - Deletion
  - Traversal
  - Search
  - Recursive operations (for trees)
- Write clean, readable, and modular Go code that follows Go best practices and documentation standards.

### 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Language:** Go (Golang)
- **Paradigm:** Structured and procedural programming
- **Version Control:** Git

This repository is ideal for students, backend developers, and Go enthusiasts who want to deepen their knowledge of data structures by building them **from scratch** using Go.
